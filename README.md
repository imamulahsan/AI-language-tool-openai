## Project Description
In this app, an user has to login in the system with his credential. If the user is new, he can register into the system. Once the user is logged in, the user can access the AI based language application like text summarization, grammar correction, keyword extraction, translation, lesson plan writing, turn by turn direction guideline, emoji chatbot, mood to color, twitter sentiment analysis, AI based rap battle, product review classification and code explanation. All the language operations are done using OpenAI API. All references related to OpenAI API can be accessed from https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference. 
> Here is the homepage of the application
